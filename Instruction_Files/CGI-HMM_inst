.TH CGI-HMM
.SH NAME
CGI-HMM - Genome scale CpG island finder by Hidden-Markov Model
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B CGI-HMM [options]
.I -p -s -l -c -r -o -S -h
.SH AVAILABILITY
Unix
.SH DESCRIPTION
CGI-HMM uses Hidden-Markov Model to locate CpG island from fasta format sequence file. The initial and transition probability are pre-calculated and stored in prob.hmm -- Or can be calculated by running GetProb module in the package. For more details about the algorithm, read the attached "Hmm find CpG island.pdf".
.SH SYSTEM REQUIREMENT
Passed test on 32bit Ubuntu with 2G memory. Recommend 64bit system with >=2G memory. 
.SH USAGE
Simply call ./CGI-HMM -s [seqfile.fasta] to work with default values.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-p [filename.hmm] use custom transition probability file. Default is "prob.hmm".
.TP
-s [seqfile.fasta] the fasta format sequence to be analyzed. Support multiple fasta sequences in one file
.TP
-l [integer] the length threshold (default=0). CGI with length smaller than this will be omitted.
.TP
-c [0~1] the GC proportion threshold (default=0.5). CGI with GC proportion smaller than this will be omitted.
.TP
-r [0~1] the Observed/Expected CpG count (default=0.6). CGI with OEratio smaller than this will be omitted.
.TP
-o [prefixname] prefix name of output (default is "CGIres").
.TP
-S set leftmost postion to 0. By default, the program set leftmost position to 1
.TP
-h open this help file
